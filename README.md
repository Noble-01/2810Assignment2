# 2810Assignment2
This assignment will test your ability to use python to interact with databases, excel workbooks, perform data analysis using NumPy, and use matplotlib to generate graphs. 
Raw data will be provided and will need to be stored in a database. You will then need to write scripts to query the database and pull out subsets of the data. 
These subsets will then need to be further analysed and have graphs procedurally generated to display relevant information. 
All of the investigations should yield results that you can present in a professional report.

There is one missing file which is the "ViolationTypes.xlsx" this could not be uploaded due to the file size being to large.
